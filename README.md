# Installation 
## Option 1 (legacy and not maintained) 
Use the simple proactive remediation that sends data direct to Log Analytics Workspace with secrets in code.

## Option 2 (strongly recommended)
Use the new and updated proactive remediation that sends data through a Azure Function App to keep secret out of code and secure that only approved and known clients can send data to your log workspace. 

1. Deploy Azure Function using our template.

	AzureADTenantID = $AzureADTenantID
	AzureADDeviceID = $AzureADDeviceID
	LogPayloads = $LogPayLoad
}
